    <h1>Tion Wayne - Wow</h1>

    <h2>Tion Wavyne</h2>

    <p> <em>Wow, man down, man down <br>
            You ain't really bad, pipe down, pipe down <br>
            I don't give a fuck right now, right now <br>
            Why everybody judge like Simon Cowell? <br>
            Pull up on my IG, undercover <br>
            But you don't like me, suck your mudda <br>
            If a nigga try me, won't recover (Yo) <br>
            If you don't like me, mm-mm (Ayy, ayy)</em> <br>
    </p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
        Pretty inna real life, on the 'Gram (Mmm) <br>
        Where you get that ass from? (Ayy) God damn (Ayy)0/ <br>
        I don't want the 'Rari, but I can (Damn) <br>
        Free up my army (Boom, boom), soon land <br>
        Know Darkoo got the strap for them <br>
        Skrr the whip like Sebastian (Bow, bow) <br>
        They don't wanna see me, no shank on 'em (Ayy) <br>
        Man a bad man, man a real, mmm-mmm <br>
        Man ah real EMD <br>
        When we inject him, ain't no BCG <br>
        Tell bro that I got him 'til the E-N-D (Ayy, ayy) <br>
        Nevеr snitch, fam, I'd rather do EPP (Grrr, bow) <br>
        Buss that case, didn't need appealing <br>
        Took out thе witness like Tommy Egan <br>
        Touch one of my dawgs, then I'm turnin' demon <br>
        It ain't ever even 'til somebody sleepin' (Ayy, ayy) <br>
        You liar and you still struggle with the O, retire br <br>
        Acting like you're always on smoke, no fire <br>
        And you can't defend your block, Maguire <br>
        Out here shottin' on the roads <br>
        But I'll spend your stack on shopping (Eh, ehn) <br>
        Made a mil, but I'll still pop him (Boom, boom) <br>
        They say "Wizzy ain't on nothing" (Bow) <br>
        So, why they see me and they runnin'? (Bow, bow)</p> <br>


    <p>[Verse 2]

        Take the weed (Woo), left the money (Woo) <br>
        Left the what? Bagged a shorty <br>
        She hid the gun in her trousers (Ah-ah) <br>
        Wasn't eatin' for twenty-four hours (Bow, bow) <br>
        But I dropped out that beautiful girl <br>
        'Cause she played both sides like Angela Valdez (Boom) <br>
        Cross country when it's all up with the pumpy <br>
        Lucky, Dillon got away from the undy <br>
        Young G, shootin' up North like Henry <br>
        Wouldn't even wanna care 'bout all the fuckery <br>
        On sight, man slap him, I ain't into online chattin' (Woo!) <br>
        The whole of the 9 confused, free SJ <br>
        'Cause we don't even know who's chattin' (Boom)</p> <br>
