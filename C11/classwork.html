<h2>Last Dance</h2>
<h3>Verse:</h3>
<p>Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
</p>
<p>You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone</p>
<p>We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance</p>
<h3>Ref:</h3>
<p>Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
</p>
